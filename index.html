                This website is currently still under construction, but let us give you a rundown
                of what GCSO is.
                <br>
                GCSO is a Virtual Reality experience, wherein the player is the pilot of a mechanised
                suit (mech)
                <br>
                fighting against a horde of hostile androids. If you're familiar with titles such as
                Killing Floor,
                <br>
                Call of Duty Zombies, Titanfall or HAWKEN, then we believe that you have something to look
                forward to in our game!
                <br>
                This website is currently under construction, and so we urge you to keep an eye on our
